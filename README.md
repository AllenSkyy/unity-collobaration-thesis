# Nutriquest

**Nutriquest** is a 3-level game designed to simulate the nationwide barangay service, **Operation Timbang (OPT)**. The game aims to educate players on the value of local health services, encouraging them to appreciate barangay operations and to participate in humanitarian activities.

## About the Game

### Operation Timbang
Operation Timbang (OPT) is an annual weighing and height measurement program for children aged five years and below, conducted within barangays. The program identifies and locates malnourished children, and the data collected is used for nutrition action planning.

### Levels Overview

- **Objective:** Classify children based on their measurements as normal, wasted, obese, and/or stunted.
- **Challenge:** Classify as many children as possible before time runs out.

#### Level 2
- **Objective:** Pack the correct nutrition kit into the right box as quickly as possible.
- **Challenge:** Traverse the map, collect the kits, and overcome obstacles blocking the path.

#### Level 3
- **Objective:** Deliver the packaged kits by passing through four checkpoints.
- **Challenge:** Avoid obstacles on the road to prevent losing points.

### Completion
Depending on their performance across the levels, players are rewarded with a certificate of gratitude for volunteering. Players who do well are encouraged to keep up the good work, while others are motivated to try again and do better next time.
